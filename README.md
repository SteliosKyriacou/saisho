# SAISHO Website

Static marketing site for SAISHO, published at **https://www.saisho.ai**.

## Deployment

The site is hosted on **GitHub Pages**, served directly from the root of the
`main` branch. There is no build step. Pushing to `main` publishes it, and the
new version is usually live within a minute or two.

The **`CNAME`** file binds the custom domain. GitHub Pages supports exactly one
custom domain per repository, so that file holds a single hostname:

```
www.saisho.ai
```

Deleting or changing `CNAME` will take the domain down, so leave it alone unless
you are deliberately moving the site. DNS for `saisho.ai` lives at GoDaddy, where
a `www` CNAME record points to `stelioskyriacou.github.io`.

Because Pages serves the repository root, **every tracked file is publicly
downloadable** at its path. Never commit anything you do not want on the open
internet. This has bitten the project before: a directory of investor decks was
committed to the predecessor repo and had to be purged from every branch's
history, which is why this repo starts from a single clean commit.

This repo replaces `SteliosKyriacou/reneubiohomepage`, which carried that
history. Nothing was copied across except the working tree as of the move.

## Structure

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Main landing page |
| `test1/index.html` | Scratch page with a GCP iframe embed |
| `isomorphiclabs/index.html` | Client-side redirect to the AlphaForge demo host |
| `bayland-capital/index.html` | Client-side redirect to the same demo host |
| `mjff/index.html` | Client-side redirect to the same demo host |
| `SV_health_Investors/index.html` | Client-side redirect to the same demo host |
| `index.css` | Stylesheet for all pages |
| `main.js` | Animated background canvas and scroll reveals |
| `assets/` | Logos, team photos, and the social preview card |

`test1/index.html` is not linked from the site's navigation; it is reachable
only by direct URL.

`aged_biology.html` and `roi_model.html` were removed: they carried the older
discovery-platform framing that contradicted the rating-agency positioning.
Both URLs now return 404. They remain in history on the `saisho-prerating`
branch.

### Social preview

`index.html` carries Open Graph and Twitter card tags. `assets/social-card.png`
is the 1200x630 preview image; it is a raster file because LinkedIn, Slack and
X do not render SVG. If the headline on the home page changes, regenerate the
card so the two do not disagree.

### Redirects

GitHub Pages cannot issue server-side 301s, so redirects are static pages
that bounce the browser client-side (`location.replace()`, with a meta
refresh fallback and a manual link). They are byte-identical apart from
their directory name:

| Path | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| `/isomorphiclabs` | `http://34.169.179.175:4003/` |
| `/bayland-capital` | `http://34.169.179.175:4003/` |
| `/mjff` | `http://34.169.179.175:4003/` |
| `/SV_health_Investors` | `http://34.169.179.175:4003/` |

Note that `/SV_health_Investors` is the only one with capitals and
underscores; the rest are lowercase and hyphenated. Pages URLs are
case-sensitive, so `/sv_health_investors` returns 404.

These are per-prospect vanity links pointing at the same demo. That target
is a bare IP served over plain HTTP, so the destination is not encrypted
and every one of these links breaks at once if the instance IP changes. To
add another, copy an existing directory and rename it. To repoint them all,
the URL appears three times in each file: the meta refresh, the Continue
link, and the `location.replace()` call.

### Logo

`assets/saisho-logo-black-bg.svg` is the pristine source asset, exactly as
supplied: black background intact, C2PA provenance manifest intact.

`assets/SAISHO-logo.svg` is the file the pages actually reference. It is the
same artwork with the opaque black background rectangle removed, so the mark
composites cleanly against the site's `#0a0f1e` background, and with the C2PA
manifest stripped (editing the file invalidates its signature, so a broken
manifest would be worse than none). Keep both.

The brand palette in `index.css` is derived from this logo's `#saishoGradient`
stops. If the logo is replaced again, update those `--logo-*` variables to
match, along with `--primary-rgb` and the `rgba()` values in `main.js`.

## Local preview

The pages use relative asset paths, so open them through a web server rather
than the filesystem:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000.

## Branches

`main` is what gets published. Snapshot branches (`saisho0`, `saisho2`, `V0`,
`V1`) are point-in-time backups and are not deployed.
